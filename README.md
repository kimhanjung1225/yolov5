# Topic: Classification and analysis of marine debris using YOLOv5

# Reason for selecting the topic

Worldwide, the problem of marine debris is causing many environmental problems. Currently, analyzing and classifying marine debris takes a lot of time and money. I hope that YOLOv5 learning can help improve marine environmental problems through efficient analysis and classification by learning marine debris video data.
